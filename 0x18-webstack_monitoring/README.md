Webstack Monitoring
To monitor our Nginx server traffic (access log and error log), I install Sumo Logic on web-01 server, create an account, and follow the setup wizard flow. The account is 30-day 'SUMO LOGIC FREE', configured for NORTH AMERICA, and Nginx is selected as Data Type to import. Sumo Logic access key is created (access id, access key).
